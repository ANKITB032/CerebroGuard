# CerebroGuard: The Context-Aware Phishing Shield üß†

CerebroGuard is an intelligent security system designed to combat sophisticated spear-phishing attacks by moving beyond traditional keyword filtering. It analyzes the underlying context, relationships, and behavioral patterns within communications to identify threats that would otherwise go unnoticed.

## üöÄ Live Demo

The fully functional prototype is deployed on Render and is accessible at:
